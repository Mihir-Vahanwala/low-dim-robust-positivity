\section{Extensions and Perspective}
As outlined at the outset, we contributed towards a sharp and comprehensive picture of what is \textit{decidable} about Robust Positivity Problems for real algebraic Linear Recurrence Sequences. An obvious, but possibly tedious future direction would be to tie up the book-keeping loose ends, and meticulously account for the complexity. 

At a higher level, we note that we restricted ourselves to the rather computationally natural solution space basis. Now that we have taken a significant initial step in chartering the robustness landscape, it is natural to ask whether, and how one can deal with neighbourhoods in different bases (e.g.\ the initialisation space), or even neighbourhoods that might not be perfect (hyper-)spheres.

In the grand Formal Methods scheme, the study of Hyper-properties \cite{hyperproperties} is an exciting natural way robustness problems for Linear Dynamical Systems could fit in. Hyper-logics reason about sets of traces of an infinite time system, rather than a single trace. They gained importance as a means to verify security in view of attacks like Meltdown and Spectre. A quintessential hyper-property, for instance, would specify a reasonable notion of \textit{indistinguishability} of traces. In that regard, our notions of $r$-Robust Positivity and $r$-Robust Uniform Ultimate Positivity bear striking resemblance. Exploring deeper connections is a fascinating future research avenue.
