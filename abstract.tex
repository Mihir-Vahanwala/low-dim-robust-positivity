Linear Recurrence Sequences (LRS) are a fundamental mathematical primitive for a plethora of applications such as model checking, probabilistic systems, computational biology and economics. Positivity (are all terms of the given LRS at least $0$?) and Ultimate Positivity (are all but finitely many terms of the given LRS at least $0$?) are important open number-theoretic decision problems. Recently, the robust versions of these problems, that ask whether the LRS is (Ultimately) Positive despite small perturbations to its initialisation, have gained attention. In this paper, we consider the neighbourhood as specified in the input of the robust decision problems. We show decidability up to order 4. Further, we show by way of hardness that decidability of either problem at order 5 would entail major breakthroughs in the number-theoretic field of Diophantine approximation.
