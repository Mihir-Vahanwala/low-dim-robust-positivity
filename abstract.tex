Linear Recurrence Sequences (LRS) are a fundamental mathematical primitive for a plethora of applications such as the verification of probabilistic systems, model checking, computational biology, and economics. Positivity (are all terms of the given LRS at least $0$?) and Ultimate Positivity (are all but finitely many terms of the given LRS at least $0$?) are important open number-theoretic decision problems. Recently, the robust versions of these problems, that ask whether the LRS is (Ultimately) Positive despite small perturbations to its initialisation, have gained attention as a means to model the imprecision that arises in practical settings. In this paper, we consider Robust Positivity and Ultimate Positivity problems where the neighbourhood of the initialisation, specified in a natural and general format, is also part of the input. We contribute by proving sharp decidability results: in each case, decidability at orders our techniques can't handle would entail significant number-theoretic breakthroughs.
