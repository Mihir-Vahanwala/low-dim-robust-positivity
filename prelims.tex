\subsection{Algebraic Numbers}
We make a few remarks regarding the representation of numbers. $\naturals$, $\integers$, $\rationals$, $\reals$, and $\complexes$ respectively denote the natural numbers, integers, rationals, reals, and complex numbers. 

A complex number $\alpha$ is said to be algebraic if it is a root of a polynomial with integer coefficients. Algebraic numbers form an algebraically closed field, denoted by $\algebraics$. We denote the field of real algebraic numbers by $\realalgebraics$. In this paper, we work with real algebraic LRS.

For an algebraic number $\alpha$, its defining polynomial $p_\alpha$ is the unique polynomial in $\integers[X]$ of least degree such that the GCD of its coefficients is $1$ and $\alpha$ is one of its roots.
Given a polynomial $p \in \integers[X]$, we denote the length of its representation by $\text{size}(p)$; its height, denoted by $H(p)$, is the maximum absolute value of the coefficients of $p$; $d(p)$ denotes the degree of $p$. The height $H(\alpha)$ and degree $d(\alpha)$ of $\alpha$ are defined to be the height and degree of $p_\alpha$.

A separation bound provided in \cite{mignottecon} establishes that for distinct roots $\alpha$ and $\beta$ of a polynomial $p \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$,
$|\alpha - \beta| > \frac{\sqrt{6}}{d^{(d+1)/2}H^{d-1}}$.
This bound allows one to represent an algebraic number $\alpha$ as a 4-tuple $(p,a,b,r)$ where $\alpha$ is the only root of $p$ at distance $\leq r$ if $a+ib$, and we use $\text{size}{\alpha}$ to denote the size of this representation, i.e., number of bits needed to write down this 4-tuple.

Further, we note that two distinct algebraic numbers $\alpha$ and $\beta$, are always roots of $p_\alpha p_\beta$, and we can thus use the root separation bound above to lower bound their distance.

Given a polynomial $p\in \integers[X]$, one can compute its roots in polynomial time \cite{findroots1operate1}. Recently, implementations of algorithms to factor polynomials in $\algebraics[X]$ have been verified \cite{factor-algebraic}. Given $\alpha$, $\beta$ two algebraic numbers, one can always compute the representations of $\alpha+\beta$, $\alpha\beta$, $\frac 1 \alpha$, $\Re(\alpha)$, $\Im(\alpha)$ in polynomial time wrt the size of their representations. \cite{findroots1operate1,findroots2operate2}.

\subsection{First Order Theory of the Reals}
This logical theory reasons about the universe of real numbers, and is denoted $\seq{\reals; +, \cdot, \ge, 0, 1}$. That is, variables take real values; terms can be added and multiplied, we have the comparison predicate, and direct access to the constants $0$ and $1$. With existential quantifiers and polynomials, we can thus express algebraic constants too. Formally, we have access to only the existential quantifier, negation, and disjunction; however, this can express the universal quantifier and all other Boolean connectives as well.

Variables are either quantified or free. Remarkably, the First Order Theory of the Reals admits quantifier elimination: for any formula $\chi(\mathbf{x})$, whose free variables are $\mathbf{x}$, there exists an \textbf{equivalent} formula $\psi(\mathbf{x})$ that does not contain any quantified variables. The following result is relevant to us.
\begin{theorem}[Renegar \cite{renegar}]
\label{thm:renegar}
Let $M \in \naturals$ be fixed. Let $\chi(\mathbf{x})$ be a formula with fewer than $M$ variables in total. There exists a procedure that returns an equivalent quantifier-free formula $\psi(\mathbf{x})$ in disjunctive normal form. This procedure runs in time polynomial in the size of the representation of $\chi$.
\end{theorem}
